# Backup_python_scripts
When implementing lots of experiments and changes for model designs, it's easy to lose track of changes, especially after several days. Usually, not all variations can be easily captured in the config files or hyperparameterized. To ensure you can trace back modifications that correspond to specific results, back up all Python code used into the results folder. This approach helps manage model development and numerous experiments effectively.
